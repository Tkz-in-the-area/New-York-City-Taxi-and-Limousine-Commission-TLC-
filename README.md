🗽 NYC Taxi Fare Prediction Project

A regression modeling project using New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) data to estimate taxi fares before a ride begins. This project was developed as part of a data science portfolio to demonstrate end-to-end analytical thinking, model development, and storytelling.

🚕 Project Overview

The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) collects extensive data on taxi trips across New York City. This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates taxi fares based on trip features such as distance, time, location, and passenger count.

- Regression modeling and feature engineering
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with Python (pandas, NumPy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Business storytelling and stakeholder communication
- Project planning and documentation

📊 Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Markdown and PDF for documentation

📈 Model Goal

To predict taxi fares with high accuracy using historical trip data, enabling:

- Fare transparency for passengers
- Better pricing strategies for drivers and fleet managers
- Enhanced urban mobility insights for policymakers

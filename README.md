🗽 NYC Taxi Fare Prediction Project

A regression modeling project using New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) data to estimate taxi fares before a ride begins. This project was developed as part of a data science portfolio to demonstrate end-to-end analytical thinking, model development, and storytelling.

🚕 Project Overview

The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) collects extensive data on taxi trips across New York City. This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates taxi fares based on trip features such as distance, time, location, and passenger count.
